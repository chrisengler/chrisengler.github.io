<p>I use this site to learn and experiment with HTML.  If you want to try this too, I highly recommend <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/">w3schools</a> for their free HTML tutorial</p>
<p>This site is also hosted for free using <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>.  An excellent place to learn source code control.</p>
